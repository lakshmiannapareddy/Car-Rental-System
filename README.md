# Car Rental System

A simple **console-based Car Rental System** built using **Core Java**.  
It allows customers to rent cars, return them, and view available vehicles — all managed through a simple text-based menu.  
This project demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts like classes, encapsulation, constructors, and collections.
